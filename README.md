# <Josh's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This is a shory study guide regarding the basics for introductory coding. I completed this as a means of documenting new coding information I can refer to later, while also meeting the Pre-Course requirements for my upcoming Bootcamp. It will help me have a starting point to refer to with upcoming coding struggles, and also have a reference point to see how far I will eventually progress.
